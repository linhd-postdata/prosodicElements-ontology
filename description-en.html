<p>As mentioned in previously sections, the objective of this ontology is to cover the aspects relating to the prosodic analysis of a poem. This ontology contains the classes and properties necessary to structure the information of a prosodic analysis, that is to say, the information obtained from the study of the meters and the forms of versification.
In poetry, the metric is the basic rhythmic structure of the verses of a poetic work.</p>
<p>The classes defined in ontology focus primarily on  handling of metric patterns using the class <a href="http://postdata.linhd.uned.es/ontology/postdata-prosodicElements#LinePattern">LinePattern</a>, <a href="http://postdata.linhd.uned.es/ontology/postdata-prosodicElements#StanzaPattern">StanzaPattern</a> and <a href="http://postdata.linhd.uned.es/ontology/postdata-prosodicElements#WorkPattern">WorkPattern</a>. There is also a class for modelling <a href="http://postdata.linhd.uned.es/ontology/postdata-prosodicElements#Rhyme">rhymes</a> and another <a href="http://postdata.linhd.uned.es/ontology/postdata-prosodicElements#Metaplasm">Metaplasm</a> class for processing and storing information about a figure of transformation or metaplasm is a figure of diction that consists of altering the writing or pronunciation of words without altering their meaning.<br/>
<p>We have taken into account are the possibility  to contemplate all the information necessary for prosodic analysis. In this sense, the following classes, among others, are defined:<br/>
	<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://postdata.linhd.uned.es/ontology/postdata-prosodicElements#Rhyme">Rhyme</a>  class to represent the repetition of similar sounding words occurring at the end of lines in poems or songs .</li>
<li>The <a href="http://postdata.linhd.uned.es/ontology/postdata-prosodicElements#Foot">Foot</a> class to represent a unit of poetic meter  in most Indo-European poetic traditions, including the English syllabic verse and the quantitative compass of Greek and ancient Latin classical poetry.  However, the metric syllable as metric unit in other traditions such as Spanish poetry is also contemplate.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://postdata.linhd.uned.es/ontology/postdata-prosodicElements#MetricalEncoding">MetricalEncoding</a> class to define the notation employed to represent a metrical pattern, for example, the plus sign to encode  strong positions metric coding.</li>
</ul>
